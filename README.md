# PersonalBlog-PHP-Takuya-WhatIUse
Website completely based on Takuya Matsuyama's WhatIUse web! I tried to replicate the web Takuya's did because I really like how it look almost in every aspect and because I have not seen a similar web like this one before. In this case, I've made it completely in Php, with a backend included!
