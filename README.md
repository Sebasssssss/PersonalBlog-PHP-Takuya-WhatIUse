# PersonalBlog-PHP-Takuya-WhatIUse
Website completely based on Takuya Matsuyama's WhatIUse web! I tried to replicate the web Takuya's did because I really like how it look almost in every aspect and because I have not seen a similar web like this one before. In this case, I've made it completely in Php, with a backend included!![yu8r9KS_6-uQSlCtscH-Nu3duNChr-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105828786/201494860-9886862a-561f-4a3a-97d6-426104756736.png)

The table created in the database, has a column called categories which is linked to another table where you can add or delete new categories! This helped to make the different sections of categories in the frontend, where you can navigate through the menu icon in the navbar!![Alt text](../../../Users/sebas/OneDrive/Documentos/WhatIUse%20timeline/categories.png)
