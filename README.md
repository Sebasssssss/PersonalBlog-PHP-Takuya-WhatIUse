# PersonalBlog-PHP-Takuya-WhatIUse
Website completely based on Takuya Matsuyama's WhatIUse web! I tried to replicate the web Takuya's did because I really like how it look almost in every aspect and because I have not seen a similar web like this one before. In this case, I've made it completely in Php, with a backend included!![yu8r9KS_6-uQSlCtscH-Nu3duNChr-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105828786/201494860-9886862a-561f-4a3a-97d6-426104756736.png)

# Frontend
This is my firs time building a web that supports dark mode, and in my opinion the transitions between dark and light mode, is one of my favourite things (This is one of the reasons i loved the original one)
